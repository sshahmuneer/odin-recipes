        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Perfectly cooked hard-boiled eggs. While you do not taste 
            the vinegar or salt, they both pull the skin from the 
            eggshell so it peels easily without tearing or sticking.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>6 cups water</li>
            <li>8 large eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine salt, vinegar, and water in a large pot, and bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
            <li>Add eggs one at a time, being careful not to crack them. Reduce the heat to a gentle boil, and cook for 14 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once eggs have cooked, remove them from the hot water, and place into a container of ice water or cold, 
                running water. Cool completely, about 15 minutes. Store in the refrigerator up to 1 week.</li>
        </ol>
